<p>This guide aims at showing different examples of how the data produced by the irace configurator can be visualized to obtain information about algorithm performance or high-performing parameters settings.</p>
<div id="about-the-execution-of-irace" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#about-the-execution-of-irace" class="anchor"></a>About the execution of irace</h2>
<p>To use the methods provided by this package you must have an irace data object, this object is saved as an Rdata file (irace.Rdata by default) after each irace execution.</p>
<p>During the configuration procedure irace evaluates several candidate configurations (parameter settings) on different training insrances, creating an algorithm performance data set we call the <em>training data set</em>. This information is thus, the data that irace had access to when configuring the algorithm.</p>
<p>You can also enable the test evaluation option in irace, in which a set of elite configurations will be evaluated on a set of test instances after the execution of irace is finished. Nota that this option is not enabled by default and you must provide the test instances in order to enable it. The performance obtained in this evalaution is called the <em>test data set</em>. This evaluation helps assess the results of the configuration in a more “real” setup. For example, we can assess if the configuration process incurred in overtuning or if a type of instance was underrepresented in the training set. We note that irace allows to perform the test evaluations to the final elite configurations and to the elite configurations of each iterations. For information about the irace setup we refer you to the irace package user guide.</p>
<p>Note: Before executing irace, consider setting the test evaluation option of irace.</p>
<p>Once irace is executed, you can load the irace data object in the R console by:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/load.html">load</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"path/to/irace.Rdata"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will load in the console an object called <code>iraceResults</code> which contains all data generated and used by the configurator.</p>
</div>
<div id="configurations" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#configurations" class="anchor"></a>Configurations</h2>
<p>Once irace is executed, the first thing you might want to do is to visualize how the best configurations look like. You can do this with the <code>parallel_coord</code> method.</p>

<p>In some cases in might be interesting to have a look to the values sampled during the configuration procedure as they indicate the areas in the parameter space where irace detected a high performance.</p>
<p>A general overview of the sampling of one parameter can be obtained with the <code>sampling_frequency</code> function:</p>

<p>A detailed plot showing the sampling by iteration can be obtained with the <code>sampling_frequency_iteration</code> function. This plot shows the convergence of the configuration process reflected in the sampled parameter values.</p>
