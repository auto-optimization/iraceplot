<p>The iraceplot package provides a set of functions to create plots to visualize the configuration data generated by the configuration process implemented in the irace package.</p>
<p>The configuration process performed by irace will show ar the end of the execution one or more configurations that are the best performing configurations found. This package provides a set of functions that allow to further assess the performance of these configurations and provides support to obtain insights about the details of the configuration process.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use">How to use<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-to-use"></a>
</h3>
<p>This is a basic example that shows how to use iraceplot:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://auto-optimization.github.io/iraceplot/" class="external-link">iraceplot</a></span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To use the functions its required to have the log file generated by irace (logFile option in the irace package). This file is commonly saved in the in the directory in which irace was executed with the name <code>irace.Rdata</code>. To load the irace log data, replace the path of the file with yours:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/load.html" class="external-link">load</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"~/path/to/irace.Rdta"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This file contains the <code>iraceResults</code> variable which contains the irace log. For more details about this variable, please go to the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/irace/vignettes/irace-package.pdf" class="external-link">user guide</a> of the irace package.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="executing-irace">Executing irace<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#executing-irace"></a>
</h3>
<p>To use the methods provided by this package you must have an irace data object, this object is saved as an Rdata file (irace.Rdata by default) after each irace execution.</p>
<p>During the configuration procedure irace evaluates several candidate configurations (parameter settings) on different training insrances, creating an algorithm performance data set we call the <em>training data set</em>. This information is thus, the data that irace had access to when configuring the algorithm.</p>
<p>You can also enable the test evaluation option in irace, in which a set of elite configurations will be evaluated on a set of test instances after the execution of irace is finished. Nota that this option is not enabled by default and you must provide the test instances in order to enable it. The performance obtained in this evalaution is called the <em>test data set</em>. This evaluation helps assess the results of the configuration in a more “real” setup. For example, we can assess if the configuration process incurred in overtuning or if a type of instance was underrepresented in the training set. We note that irace allows to perform the test evaluations to the final elite configurations and to the elite configurations of each iterations. For information about the irace setup we refer you to the irace package user guide.</p>
<p>Note: Before executing irace, consider setting the test evaluation option of irace.</p>
<p>Once irace is executed, you can load the irace log in the R console as previously shown.</p>

<p>Once irace is executed, the first thing you might want to do is to visualize how the best configurations look like. You can do this with the <code>parallel_coord</code> method:</p>

The plot produced by <code>parallel_coord</code> can help you to both the distribution of the parameter values of a set of configurations and the common associations between these values. By default, the plot colors the lines using the number of instances evaluated by the configuration. You can use the <code>color_by_instances</code> argument to choose between coloring the lines by the number of instances executed or the last iteration the configurationwas executed on.</p>
<p>To visualize the configurations considered as elites in each iteration use the <code>iterations</code> option. You can select one or more iterations. For example, to select all iterations executed by irace:</p>

The configurations must be provided in the format in which irace handles configurations: a dataframe with parameter in each column.

<code>parallel_cat</code> function displays all configurations sampled in a set of iterations. The plot groups parameter values in intervals and thus, it can be useful to visualize more tendencies of association between parameters values. As in the previous functions you can use the <code>iterations</code> argument to select the iterations from which configurations should be selected. For example, to visualize configurations sampled on iterations 3, 4 and 5:</p>

<p><img src="guide_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>You can also adjust the number of value intervals that are displayed for each parameter using the <code>n_bins</code> parameter which by default is set to 3. Also, it is possible to select a subset of configurations using the <code>id_configurations</code> argument providing a vector a configuration ids.</p>
<p>Both in the <code>parallel_coord</code> and <code>parallel_cat</code> functions parameters can be selected using the <code>param_names</code> argument. For example to select parameters un <code>parallel_cat</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../../reference/parallel_cat.html">parallel_cat</a></span><span class="op">(</span>irace_results <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">iraceResults</span>,

<p><img src="guide_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>This setting is useful to visualize the association between parameters that, for example, seem to interact. For configuration scenarios that define a large number of parameters, it is impossible to visualize all parameters in one of these plots. If do not know which parameters to select, all parameters can be split in different plots using the <code>by_n_param</code> argument which specifies the maximum number of parameters to include in a plot. The functions will generate as many plots as needed to cover all parameters included.</p>

<p>The <code>sampling_pie</code> function creates a plot that displays the values of all configurations sampled during the configuration process. This plot can be useful to display the tendencies in the sampling in a simple format. As well as in the <code>previous</code>parallel_cat` plot, numerical parameters domains are discretized to be shown in the plot. The size of each parameter value in the plot is dependent of the number of configurations having that value in the configurations.</p>

<p>If you would like to visualize the distribution of a particular set of configurations, you can pass directly a set of configurations and a parameters object in the irace format to the <code>sampling_frequency</code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"> <span class="fu"><a href="../../reference/sampling_frequency.html">sampling_frequency</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">iraceResults</span><span class="op">$</span><span class="va">allConfigurations</span>, <span class="va">iraceResults</span><span class="op">$</span><span class="va">parameters</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The previous functions display the parameter frequency plots grouped by 9 plots, you can adjust this setting using the <code>n</code> argument. You can select the parameters to be displayed, with the <code>param_names</code> argument. You can use these plots to ge a general idea of the area of the parameter space in which the sampling performed by irace was focused. For example:</p>

<p><img src="guide_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>If you would like to see more details, a plot showing the sampling by iteration can be obtained with the <code>sampling_frequency_iteration</code>function. This plot shows the convergence of the configuration process reflected in the parameter values sampled each iteration:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../../reference/sampling_frequency_iteration.html">sampling_frequency_iteration</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">iraceResults</span>, param_name <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"beta"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="guide_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>In some cases, you may want to assess how the sampling frequencies of two parameters are related. You can visualize the joint sampling frequency of two parameters using the <code>sampling_heatmap</code> function. By default, this plot uses the elite configurations values (of all configurations), you can allow the plot to show all sampled configurations using the <code>only_elite</code> argument. You must select two parameters using the <code>param_names</code> argument, for example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../../reference/sampling_heatmap.html">sampling_heatmap</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">iraceResults</span>, param_names <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html" class="external-link">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"beta"</span>,<span class="st">"alpha"</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="guide_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>You can also select the iterations from which configurations will be selected using the <code>iterations</code> argument. The size of the intervals considered for numerical parameters in the heatmap can be also adjusted, see the example to have more details.</p>
<p>If you would like to display a set of configurations directly provided by you, use the <code>sampling_heatmap2</code> function. In both <code>sampling_heatmap2</code> and <code>sampling_heatmap2</code>, you can adjust the number of intervals to be displayed for numerical parameters using the <code>sizes</code> argument. For example, we set to 5 the number of intervals displayed for the second parameter, which is numerical, using <code>sizes=c(0,5)</code>. The the 0 value in this argument indicates that the default interval size should be used. In this case, we set 0 for the first parameter but note that it is not possible to adjust the number of intervals for categorical or ordered parameter types.</p>

<h3 id="sampling-distance">Sampling distance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sampling-distance"></a>
</h3>
<p>You may like to have a general overview of the distance of the configurations sampled across the configuration process. This can allow you to assess the convergence of the configuration process. The mean distance between the sampled configurations can be visualized using the <code>sampling_distance</code> function. This function compares the parameter values of all configurations and aggregates these comparisons to calculate the overall distance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../../reference/sampling_distance.html">sampling_distance</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">iraceResults</span>, t<span class="op">=</span><span class="fl">0.05</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="guide_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Note that for categorical and ordered parameters the comparison is straightforward, but this is not the case for numerical parameters. The argument <code>t</code> defines a percentage used to define a domain interval to assess equality of numerical parameters. For example, if the domain of a parameter is <code>[0,10]</code> and <code>t=0.1</code> then when comparing any value to <code>v=2</code> we define an interval <code>s=t* (upper_bound -lower_bound) = 0.1*(10-0)=1</code>. Then all values in the interval <code>[v-s, v+s] [1,3]</code> will be equal to <code>v=2</code>.</p>

<p>When executing irace, you can enable the testing feature that will evaluate elite configurations in a set of test instances. For more details about how you can use this feature check the irace package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/irace/vignettes/irace-package.pdf" class="external-link">user guide</a>.</p>
<p>The test performance of the evaluated configurations can be visualised using the <code>boxplot_test</code> function. Note that the irace execution log file includes test data (test is not enabled by default).</p>

<p>This plot shows all final elite configurations evaluation on the test instance set, we can compare the performance of these configurations to select one that has the best test performance. Note that the best configuration (identified by irace) is displayed in a different color. By default, the plot displayes the relative percentage deviation of the performance of the configurations, to disable this and display the raw performance use the <code>rpd=FALSE</code> argument.</p>
<p>If the irace log file includes the evaluation on the test set of the iteration elite configurations, its possible to plot the test performance of elite configurations across the iterations using the argument <code>type="all"</code>. The best elite configuration on each iteration is displayed in different color:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../../reference/boxplot_test.html">boxplot_test</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">iraceResults</span>, type<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">"all"</span>, show_points<span class="op">=</span><span class="cn">FALSE</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="guide_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>This plot allows to assess the progress of the configuration process regarding the test set performance, which would be useful when dealing with heterogeneous instance sets. In these cases, good configurations across the full set can be challenging to find and it is possible that the algorithm could be mislead if instances sets are prone to introduce bias due to instance ordering.</p>
<p>Note that in this example the elite configuration with id 808 seems to have a slightly better performance<br>
than the configuration identified as the best (id:809) by irace. It is important to note that all elite configurations are not statistically different and thus, its very possible that such situation is observed when evaluuting test performance, specially when configuring heterogeneous, difficult to balance, instance sets.</p>
<p>If you would like further detauls about the difference in the performance of two configurations, you can use the <code>scatter_test</code> function. This function displays the performance of both configurations paired by instance (each point represents an instance):</p>

<p>During the execution of irace considerable performance data is obtained in order to assess the performance of the candidate configurations. This data can be useful to understand the performance of the configured algorithm and to get insights about how to improve the configuration process.</p>
<p>The following functions create plots of the training data in the irace log. Note that this data is obtained during the search of good configurations. Due to the racing procedure, some configurations are more evaluated than others (best configurations are more evaluated than poor performing configurations). See the irace package documentation for details.</p>
<p>Visualizing training performance might help to obtain insights about the reasoning that followed irace when searching the parameter space, and thus it can be used to understand why irace considers certain configurations as high or low performing.</p>
<p>To visualize the performance of the final elites as observed by irace, the <code>boxplot_training</code> function plots the experiments performed on these configurations. Note that this data corresponds to the performance generated during the configuration process thus, the number of instances on which the configurations were evaluated might vary between elite configurations.</p>

<p>You can select to display the elite configurations of a different iteration by using the <code>iteration</code>. In case you would like to visualize non-elite configurations you can directly provide the instance ids using the `.

<p>You can use the following functions to plot the performance of a selected set of configurations in an experiment matrix provided directly by you. These functions can be also useful when you would like to compare a configuration that was not generated in the configuration process. Note thar such comparison should be carefully considered as execution conditions might differ from the ones when irace was executed. Keep in mind that irace provides seeds to execute instances when configuring stochastic algorithms and also might define an execution bound when adaptive capping is active. Check the irace package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/irace/vignettes/irace-package.pdf" class="external-link">user guide</a> for details about this.</p>
<p>To plot the performance of a selected set of configurations in an experiment matrix, you can use the <code>boxplot_performance</code> function. The configurations can be selected in a vector (allElites):</p>

<p>The experiment matrix should be provided in the irace format, columns should have configuration ids as names (character) and rows names can be instances names (optional).</p>
<p>If the configurations are provided in a list, then the different elements of this list will be considered as iterations. Note that this matches the <code>iraceResults$allElites</code> variable in the irace log. For example, to plot 3 configurations as they are assigned to 3 different iterations:</p>

<p>This plot shows configurations in the x axis and instances in the y axis. Each point in the plot display in color the ranking of the configuration on each instance. If <code>interactive = TRUE</code>, you can place your cursor on each point to visualize the configuration id, instance id, and the rank of the configuration.</p>
<p>The sampling distributions used by irace during the configuration process can be displayed using the <code>plot_model</code> function. For categorical parameters, this function displays the sampling probabilities associated to each parameter value by iteration (x axis top) in each elite configuration model (bars):</p>
