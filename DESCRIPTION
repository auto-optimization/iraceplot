Description: Graphical visualization tools for analyzing the data produced by 'irace'. 'Iraceplot' aims at enabling users to analyze the performance and the parameter space data sampled by the configuration during the search process. It provides a set of functions that generate different plots to visualize the configurations sampled during the execution of 'irace' and their performance. The functions just require the log file generated by 'irace' and, in some cases, they can be used with user-provided data.
