<dd><p>Numeric (optional), maximum number of parameters to be displayed.</p></dd>


<dt>color_by_instances</dt>

    <p>The parameters to be included in the plot can be selected with the param_names
argument. Additionally, the maximum number of parameters to be displayed in one
plot. A list of plots is returned by this function in several plots are required
to display the selected data.</p>
<p>To export the plot to a file, it is possible to do it so manually using the
functionality provided by plotly in the plot. If a filename is provided,
orca server will be used to export the plots and thus, it requires the library
to be installed (<a href="https://github.com/plotly/orca" class="external-link">https://github.com/plotly/orca</a>).</p>
