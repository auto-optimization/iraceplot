\title{Performance Scatter Plot of Two Configurations}
\usage{
scatter_performance(
  experiments,
  x_id,
  y_id,
  rpd = TRUE,
  filename = NULL,
  interactive = base::interactive(),
  instance_names = NULL
)

scatter_training(irace_results, ...)

scatter_test(irace_results, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{experiments}{Experiment matrix obtained from irace training or testing data. Configurations
in columns and instances in rows. As in irace, column names (configurations ids)
should be characters. Row names will be used as instance names.}

\item{x_id, y_id}{Configuration IDs for x-axis and y-axis, respectively.}

\item{rpd}{(\code{logical(1)}) TRUE to plot performance as the relative
percentage deviation to best results per instance, FALSE to plot raw
performance.}

\item{filename}{(\code{character(1)}) File name to save the plot, for example \code{"~/path/example/filename.png"}.}

\item{interactive}{(\code{logical(1)}) TRUE if the plot is generated
interactively (using \code{plotly}) or FALSE it is generated
statically. Defaults to the value returned by \code{interactive()},}

\item{instance_names}{Either a character vector of instance names in the
same order as \code{rownames(experiments)} or a function that takes
\code{rownames(experiments)} as input.}

\item{irace_results}{The data generated when loading the \code{Rdata} file created by \code{irace}}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link[=scatter_performance]{scatter_performance()}}.}

\description{
Create a scatter plot that displays the performance of two configurations on
a provided experiment matrix. Each point in the plot represents an instance
and the color of the points indicates if one configuration is better than
the other.
}
\details{
The performance matrix is assumed to be provided in the format of the irace
experiment matrix thus, NA values are allowed. Consequently the number of
evaluations can differ between configurations due to the elimination process
applied by irace. This plot only shows performance data only for instances
in which both configurations are executed.

\code{\link[=scatter_training]{scatter_training()}} compares the performance of two configurations on the
training instances. The performance data is obtained from the evaluations
performed by irace during the execution process.

\code{\link[=scatter_test]{scatter_test()}} compares the performance of two configurations on the test
instances. The performance data is obtained from the test evaluations
performed by irace.  Note that testing is not enabled by default in irace
and should be enabled in the scenario setup. Moreover, configuration ids
provided in \code{x_id} and \code{y_id} should belong to elite configuration set
evaluated in the test (see the irace package user guide for more details).
