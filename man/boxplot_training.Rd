\usage{
boxplot_training(
  irace_results,
  iteration = NULL,
  id_configurations = NULL,
  rpd = TRUE,
  show_points = TRUE,
  filename = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{irace_results}{The data generated when loading the \code{Rdata} file created by \code{irace}}

\item{iteration}{Numeric, iteration number that should be included in the plot (example: iteration = 5)
When no iteration and no id_condigurations are provided, the iterations is assumed to be
the last one performed by irace.

The performance data is obtained from the evaluations performed by irace
during the execution process. This implies that the number of evaluations
can differ between configurations due to the elimination process applied by
irace. This plot, consequently, does not provide a complete compaarison of
two configurations, for a fair comparison use the test data plot.}

\item{id_configurations}{Numeric vector, configurations ids whose performance should be included in the plot.
If no ids are provided, the configurations ids are set as the elite configuration ids
of the selected iteration (last iteration by default)
(example: \code{id_configurations = c(20,50,100,300,500,600,700)}).}

\item{rpd}{(\code{logical(1)}) TRUE to plot performance as the relative
percentage deviation to best results per instance, FALSE to plot raw
performance.}

\item{show_points}{Logical, (default TRUE) TRUE to plot performance points together with the box plot.}

\item{filename}{(\code{character(1)}) File name to save the plot, for example \code{"~/path/example/filename.png"}.}

\description{
Creates a box plot that displays the performance of a set of configurations
on the training instances. Performance data is obtained from the evaluations
performed by irace during the execution process. This implies that the
number of evaluations can differ between configurations.
