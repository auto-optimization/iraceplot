<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of iraceplot is to generate various types of graphs that help to
better understand the data generated by irace

## Install Iraceplot

For installing iraceplot you need to install the devtools package:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```
Currently, the Irace Studio package can be installed from Gtihub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("pabloOnate/iraceplot")
```

## How To Use

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(iraceplot)
```

you need to have the file generated by irace (.Rdata) loaded, you must replace the path of the file with yours

``` r
load("~/patch/example/name.Rdata")
```
