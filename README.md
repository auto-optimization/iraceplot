The goal of iraceplot package is to generate various types of graphs that help to
better understand the data generated by irace

For installing iraceplot you need to install the devtools package:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```
Currently, the Irace Studio package can be installed from Gtihub:

``` r
load("~/patch/example/name.Rdata")
```

# Functions
